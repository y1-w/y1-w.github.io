I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore. 
I received B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology in 2019 from Jilin University (JLU), Changchun, China. 
From 2019 to 2021, I studied as a direct doctoral student at the State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University (FDU), Shanghai, China. 
I worked as a research intern at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Research with the Integrated Communications and AI Lab, Singapore in 2024. 
I was awarded the Samsung Scholarship at Jilin University in 2018 and the Micron Foundation Prize at the National University of Singapore in 2022. 
My current research focuses on energy-efficient memory-centric design for emerging electronic systems, including neural network accelerators and quantum-inspired computing systems.
