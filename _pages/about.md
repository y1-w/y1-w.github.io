I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Kelvin Xuanyao Fong](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/seeder/people/kelvinxyfong/). 
My current research focuses on non-von Neumann architectures for emerging AI algorithms, including memory-centric accelerator design and communication-aware design methodologies.
