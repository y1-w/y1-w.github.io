I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Kelvin Xuanyao Fong](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/seeder/people/kelvinxyfong/). 
My current research focuses on non-von Neumann architectures for emerging AI algorithms, including memory-centric accelerator design and communication-aware design methodologies. 

Yimin Wang received his B.S. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology in 2019 from Jilin University (JLU), Changchun, China. 
He studied as a direct doctoral student at the State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University (FDU), Shanghai, China, supervised by Prof. Zhuo Zou and Prof. Lirong Zheng from 2019 to 2021. 
During his Ph.D. studies, he worked as a research intern at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Research with the Integrated Communications and AI Lab, Singapore in 2024, advised by Dr. Tushar Chouhan and Dr. Haris Javaid. 

He was awarded the Samsung Scholarship at Jilin University in 2018 and the Micron Foundation Prize at the National University of Singapore in 2022.
